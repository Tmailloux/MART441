This weeks assignment was difficult for me to grasp at first because of the combination of reviewing js along with the complexity of creating a branching story. Once I was able to get a grasp on my different variables and the pattern that went into creating the different paths it went a lot smoother. I also wanted the image to change everytime you made a choice so finding the right syntax from googling was difficult, but ultimaley only ended up being one line of code by using:

**document.getElementById("myImage").src = 'example';**

at the top of each else if statement to change the image id in the html body.
