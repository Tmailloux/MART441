                <h2>My name's Trace and I am a junior in the Media Arts Program with
                    a focus on digital filmmaking. Although I dont have a lot of experience 
                    with coding, I feel fairly familiar with HTML and using external sheets
                    to style the content. I'm not super familair with CSS so I've spent the 
                    last few days looking over the MART 341 webpage and HTML/CSS book. I look 
                    forward to learning more!

                <h2>My interests include filmmaking, gaming, hiking and playing basketball.
                    Im excited to join this class as learning coding and website creation has 
                    been something that I have been interested in since i was a child. I hope 
                    that this could help me lay the ground work for other coding endaevors as 
                    I'm curious about getting into game design.
