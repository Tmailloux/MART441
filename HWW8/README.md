## Assignment 08

- I had some difficulty this week trying to implement past projects into the assignment. I used a combination of the w7 array setup and the w6 "random image generator" in order to randomize the images that would appear when the button was clicked. While I was able to animate the square underneath for each click I couldnt figure out how to fade the images before swapping. I tried doing a callback within the "accessInformation()" function but that made it so no new image was returned.
