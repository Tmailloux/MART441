# HWW6

After having trouble last week with the use of arrays, I felt better that it only took changing one line to get the code to work. Once I was able to implement that and the new functions to keep track of the player information the rest of the process was relatively simple. I had some issues with transferring the files into its own Week 6 repository so it may have affected my Week 5 files.
